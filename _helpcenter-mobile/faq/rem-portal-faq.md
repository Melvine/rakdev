1. Why can't I login or see my Service in REMS?

It may take about an hour for your account to properly synchronize. Try logging in again after an hour.

2. How do I find out the name of the mailing list of my Service?

The name of the mailing list follows the format dev-rems-serviceId, where serviceID is your Service Name in lower case and without space. For example:

* Service Name: Wuaki TV
* Service ID: wuakitv
* Example mailing list: dev-rems-wuakitv@mail.rakuten.com
