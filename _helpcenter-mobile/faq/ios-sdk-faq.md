1. Is the iOS SDK compatible with RestKit?

No. RestKit requires the 1.3.0 version of AFNetworking.  The iOS SDK is compatible with any AFNetworking version greater than or equal to 2.2.0.

2. I get an Error Your application is lacking the proper keychain-access-group entitlements.

Please refer to [Device Information Keychain Setup](http://www.raksdtd.com/ios-sdk/deviceinformation-LATEST/device-information-keychain-setup.html)
