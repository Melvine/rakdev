        mall_id is a static token for Global Shopping that differentiates between different marketplaces.

22. Does RAT needs to authenticate against Global ID?

        No, you do not need to use the Global id with RAT. The only requirement is to provide a string format: any user ID provided by an app team is compatible.

23. How long are RAE refresh tokens available after being published? What happens when refresh tokens expire?

     The Rakuten Ecosystem Mobile SDK provides a method to refresh the access token, using the refresh_token as a request parameter.
     
     The response to this request will include a new refresh_token. The app handles refreshing the access token if it is expired, or asks the user to login again. The refresh_token expiration must be longer than the access_token. If the refresh_token provided is invalid, the SDK returns an error.

24. The RAE client ID application form requires a service URL. What URL should I use for a new mobile app?

     If there is no URL for the service in your new mobile app, you can use a generic URL. Please note in a comment that your application is for a mobile-only service.
