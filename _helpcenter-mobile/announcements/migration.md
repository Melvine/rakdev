Dear all,

The existing announcements, developer articles, blog posts and release notes have been migrated to their own helo center category (accessible from the top page). 

All new announcements will also be available there.

This has been done to make it easier for our users to find and locate the important announcements from the top page of Help Center.

Here is how to access them:

1. Goto [https://developers.rakuten.com/](https://developers.rakuten.com/hc/en-us/)
2. Choose the Category **Announcements**

Thank you very much for your continue support and patronage.
